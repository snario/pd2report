    {This report, entitled "Professional Skills Necesaary for 
    Working in the Long-Term Health Industry" has been prepared
    as my 2A work-term report for PD2: Critical Reflection and 
    Report Writing. The purpose of this report is to discuss the
    professional skills one needs to work in the long-term health 
    industry, and to analyze the importance of these skills in any
    future industries one may work in. 
    \par \noindent
    PD2 is a course which instructs students on report writing, as
    well as critical reflection and analysis. The quizzes and 
    assignments in this course have taught me how to properly form my 
    report, while adhering to a set of specific guidelines. The writing 
    of this report has also caused me to reflect and analyse my own 
    skills and weaknesses, and how I can improve going forward.
    \par \noindent
    This report was written entirely by me and has not received any 
    previous academic credit at this or any other institution. I would
    like to thank Ms. Srishti Gupta for proofreading my report. I have
    received no other assistance.}

  \mySection{Introduction}
  {
  For the past four months, I have been employed at the company 
  PointClickCare, or PCC. PCC develops and maintains software for 
  nursing homes. At its core, the PointClickCare application manages
  Private Health Records for residents of nursing homes. One
  of the app's most important usages is its integration with other
  aspects of the senior care industry. For example, PCC interfaces 
  with software at various pharmacies, allowing a resident's  prescriptions
  to be refilled and delivered automatically.
  \par \noindent
  As a Testing Analyst in PCC's Vendor Integration Services department, my
  job was concerned with these integrations. Although I was working
  in a software position, the demands of my job required me to become
  very familiar with the long-term healthcare (LTC) industry. During my time at 
  PCC I learned and improved upon the  professional skills that are vital
  in such a niche industry.
  \par \noindent
  In this report, I will describe the various professional skills developed
  through working in the long-term healthcare industry. These include: 
  understanding legal codes, communicating effectively and problem solving 
  time-sensitive issues. My personal experiences with work, along with 
  thorough research of my comapny's documentation, and readings from outside 
  sources, allowed me to determine the importance these skills. 
  \par \noindent
  The report will then go on to analyze the applicability of these skills
  to the software industry in general, and whether they can be used in any
  future employment.

  \mySection{Professional Skills Devloped at PCC}{
      during my time at PointClickCare I had to learn several new technical
      and professional skills in order to be successful at my job. among the
      professional skills i developed, the three most important were: 
      understanding legal codes, communicating effectively and problem 
      solving time-sensitive issues.
    \mySubSection{Parsing and Understanding Legal Codes} {
      As PCC's software deals with health records of residents and patients
      at nursing homes, all of it's employees had to be compliant with all 
      laws regarding the privacy of personal health information (PHI). 
      PointClickCare's app is used in both Canada and the United States, and
      as such, we were required to comply to PIPEDA (Canada's
      Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act) and HIPAA
      (The United States' Health Insurance Portability and Accountability 
      Act). These two Acts outline the responsibilities of any corporation
      and it's employees, that deals with PHI (Statutes of Canada [SoC], 2000;
      HIPAA, 1996).
      \par \noindent
      At PointClickCare, HIPAA and PIPEDA are taken very seriously. Every 
      employee regardless of department is trained in HIPAA and PIPEDA compliance
      so that we are all aware of our personal liabilities. Awareness and 
      understanding of these acts is essential in the LTC industry, as the
      penalties for any violation of these acts can be severe. As you can 
      see in the table below, the corporate fine for a PIPEDA violation in 
      Ontario is \$250,000. HIPAA violations are equally serious, and a table
      of fines for various violations can be found in Appendix B of this
      report.
      \par \noindent
      \myTable{.75}{pipedafines.png}{PIPEDA fines in various 
      provinces (PointClickCare, 2015)}
      Understanding HIPAA and PIPEDA became extremely relevant to my daily 
      tasks at PointClickCare. As a client-facing employee, I was 
      constantly sending emails and making phone calls to external organizations.
      Any PHI, including even just a patients name, must be released only in
      confidential correspondance, and only between parties authorized to 
      handle PHI (PointClickCare, 2015). On multiple occasions, I have 
      received unencrypted emails from clients containing PHI, such as the patient's
      name. Replying to this email would be considered a HIPAA violation, 
      as the quoted text would contain the initial email. I had to constantly
      be on the lookout for such violations, since I can be held accountable
      not only for violations I committed personally, but also for any 
      violation committed by someone else that I noticed and did not report
      (SoC, 2000; HIPAA, 1996). 
      \par \noindent
      Being able to comprehend and act upon these two legal codes was 
      extremely important to my position at PCC. Any misunderstanding or
      small slip up could have cost my company thousands of dollars.
